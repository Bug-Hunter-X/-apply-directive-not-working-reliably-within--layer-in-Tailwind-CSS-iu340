/* Instead of relying solely on @apply within the @layer, we can define reusable style blocks. This approach ensures consistent style application across components. */

@layer components {
  .custom-style {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded;
  }
}

/* In this example, we use a custom class named custom-style to apply our styles.This method offers greater clarity and maintainability, compared to direct application of @apply inside a layer. */

/* Example usage: */
/*.custom-style */
