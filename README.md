# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue within @layer

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue with Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive when used inside an `@layer` declaration within a component. The `@apply` directive sometimes fails to apply the expected styles, resulting in unexpected visual inconsistencies.

## Description

The problem is not consistently reproducible, indicating a potential interaction between the `@layer` directive, the complexity of the styles, or the structure of the component's CSS. This behavior deviates from the expected functionality of `@apply`, which is to directly apply the styles defined in the utility classes.

## Reproduction

The `bug.css` file contains a simplified reproduction of the problem.  You can try modifying the component styles or nesting to observe the inconsistencies.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file showcases potential workarounds or fixes for the issue, although a conclusive solution might depend on the specific root cause.

## Further Investigation

The root cause of this erratic behavior requires deeper investigation. Factors to consider include:

* Tailwind CSS version
* PostCSS configuration
* Component structure and nesting
* Interactions with other CSS frameworks or libraries

This is a fairly uncommon and difficult to track error. We hope that this report can aid in finding the root of the problem and to find a consistent solution.
